# Surf Tools for Hammer++ (Build 8870)

A mod of [Hammer++](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/index.html) with surf-related features.

## Features

### Clip Angle Measurer
- When using the clipping tool, it will show the surf angle if it's surfable.
- **Toggle**: press `o`.

### Ramp Angle Measurer
- When selecting a solid (not an entity or group), it will show the surf angle for each surfable face.

### Angle Fix
- Requires compiling with `vbspplusplus.exe` from the [Tools++ compilers](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/tools.html) (for `func_detail_illusionary`)
- **Usage**: Select worldbrush rotated ramps and press `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + A`.

### Trigger Generator
- Creates triggers by extruding from selected faces.  
- For now they are hardcoded to be 2 unit tall `trigger_teleport`.
- You can press `Alt + Enter` after to set the teleport destination in bulk.
- **Usage**: Select some faces with the texture tool, then press `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + T`.

### Curved Ramp Generator
- Generates a curved ramp by a start segment and inputting direction, degrees, and number of segments.
- Convex ramps are not supported yet.  
- **Usage**: Select a start segment that’s not rotated, then press `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S`.

## About Angle Steepness Rating
When you see ratings like `5/10` with the angle measure tools:

- `5/10`  → "Sweet spot" (~50 degrees)
- `0/10`  → Just barely surfable
- `10/10` → Ranges from "probably too steep to be fun" all the way to "too steep to stay on the ramp"
- This may be tweaked in the future.

## Notes
- There’s also a context menu in **Tools → Surf Tools** and in the right-click context menu.
- Support for Hammer++ builds beyond 8870 will be added when they're released.
